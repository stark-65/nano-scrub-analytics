 NANO SCRUB - Advanced Analytics & ML SuiteDeveloped by: 
 
 ANKIT JHA Version: 3.5 (ML Edition)Nano Scrub is a professional-grade, high-performance data science ecosystem. It is engineered to transform raw, messy datasets into clean, analyzed, and modeled assets within seconds. Featuring a neon-infused glassmorphism UI, it integrates state-of-the-art Generative AI with a flexible Python Sandbox for custom Machine Learning workflows. Key Modules 1. Data Transformation EngineMissing Value Recovery: Impute data using Mean, Mode, or Zero-fill strategies.Outlier Scrubbing: Automated Interquartile Range (IQR) filtering to remove statistical noise.Schema Mapping: Real-time detection of data types, unique constraints, and null distributions. 2. Visual StudioInteractive Plots: Build dynamic Scatter, Bar, Line, Histogram, and Boxplots.Multi-Dimensional Analysis: Map categories to colors and facets for deeper insight.Powered by Plotly: High-fidelity, zoomable charts ready for presentation. 3. AI Automated ScientistGemini Integration: Leverages Google Gemini 1.5 to perform deep-dive pattern recognition.Context-Aware Reports: The AI understands your specific column names and descriptive statistics to provide expert-level advice. 4. Python Lab (The Sandbox)Jupyter-Style Execution: Write and run Python code directly on your uploaded dataframe (df).ML Ready: Pre-configured with scikit-learn for K-Means Clustering, Regression, and Classification.Logic Persistence: Changes made to the data in the Sandbox reflect across the entire application.🛠️ Installation & DeploymentLocal SetupClone the repository:Bashgit clone https://github.com/your-username/nano-scrub.git
